# Binary-Search-Tree
Purpose: Build a binary search tree. Perform insertions in order. Build methods for insert, search and delete.

Input: 
  Functions that you want the programming to do in menu (1) Find (2) Display (3) Balance (4) Size (5) Insert (6) Delete (7) Quit.
  Things you want to search for in the BINSEATREE  
  Things you want to insert into the BINSEATREE
  Things you want to delete from the BINSEATREE
  
Processing:  Select a function that you want to use. You can insert anything to the binary tree and the program will automatically put it   at the right position by comparing values. Find function can help to give the position of the searched value. Delete function can delete the value you input from the binary tree. However, the structure of binary tree is changing when you are doing insertion and deletion.

Output: Sorted binary tree (in sorted order).
